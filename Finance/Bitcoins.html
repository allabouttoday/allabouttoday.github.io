            <h1>Bitcoins: What are they? What can they do for you?</h1>
          </header>
          <p>Did you stumble across the word "Bitcoin" more than once in your life? If you're wondering about what it exactly is, your search has led you to the right place. Let's start with the basics.</p>
          <center>

          <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
          <p>Bitcoin is a digital currency that was created by a person/group with the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. The identity of the person who first developed Bitcoin is still a mystery to this day.<br> The creator of bitcoin had created it with the
            ideology that while people seemed to regulate currencies through banks fairly, there were still instances of frauds. He believed that while bitcoins are a risk, so are normal currencies. The currency is fairly new as it was created in
            2009.
          </p>
          <h2>Where can Bitcoins be used?</h2>
          <p>Bitcoins are accepted by a lot of merchants. By lot, we mean about 15,174 companies. These merchants include companies like Microsoft, Wikipedia, and sites like Expedia also accept payments in bitcoins. <br>Some sellers accept bitcoins
            as payment for their products on Etsy. These are only a few examples. Once you start looking into it, bitcoins are accepted as a form of payment by many companies and people.</p>

            </center>

          <h2>How do Bitcoins work?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The currency is highly volatile. The value may skyrocket up or go down quickly. Some even say that bitcoins are more volatile than gold itself.<br>

            The amount of bitcoins you have is stored in your "Bitcoin wallet". This wallet is either on the user's device or in the cloud and acts as a virtual bank account. Mind you, these wallets are not FDIC insured. Dealing in this currency
            keeps your information safe by revealing only your wallet ID in the public logs that record your transactions. The currency of bitcoins is not managed by a central bank. It involves no middlemen. The transactions are direct.
          </p>
          <h2>Where to get Bitcoins?</h2>
          <p>There are various marketplaces, i.e. bitcoin exchanges, that provide a platform for trading (buying and selling) of bitcoins in exchange for other currencies like actual USD dollars, pounds, etc. Some of these famous platforms are
            Coinbase, Bitstamp, etc. Similar to transferring cash online, Bitcoins can also be transferred through mobiles easily with the help of certain apps or computers. <br>

            You can also get bitcoins through something called "Mining". This is a process where people are rewarded bitcoins for solving complex math problems. Itâ€™s not uncommon for coins to be awarded every 10 minutes and the said problems are
            generally solved using computers.
          </p>
          <h1>Disadvantages and Drawbacks of the Bitcoin currency</h1>

          <h3>Security risks:
          </h3>
          <p>While you can use bitcoins as a form of exchange easily, there's a huge risk of losing all the bitcoins you have managed to collect or save up. The sites on which these coins are traded can get hacked. Many people have lost their
            bitcoins through either hacking of cloud servers on which their wallets are or destruction of the wallet on their computer through viruses. A trading platform of this cryptocurrency called Bitfinex was hacked in 2016. Millions of dollars
            were lost due to this.</p>
          <h3>Wrong use of privacy:</h3>
          <p>Bitcoins provide anonymity when it comes to buying or selling things using bitcoins. It's hard to trace back transactions made using bitcoins. This gives people from the black market considerable advantage to use the currency for
            dealings in drugs and all things illegal.</p>
          <h3>What next?
          </h3>
          <p>Countries like Japan and Australia have started thinking about the construction of regulations as bitcoins are generally unregulated. There's a lack of control over this currency and the taxation issues that worries the governments.
            While its hard-earned highly volatile money, it can just as easily disappear due to risks.</p>
