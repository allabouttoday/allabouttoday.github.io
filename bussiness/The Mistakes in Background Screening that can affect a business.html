					<p>Companies that are aware of the background screening fold have come to recognize its significance and its advantages, which help make contracting expenses and work of reliable hiring genuine and capable employees.

						In some cases, Employees hired are new; they may be bound to be forced to bear the errors of their verification accomplice.<br />



						But being new to this process, they are destined to be on the receipt end vague and meaningless done by their background verification company.<br />

						Let’s take a look at common mistakes. Let us show you how it can affect your business and how to overcome this.

					<h2><strong>Lack of Standardized Practices</strong></h2>
					<img class="image main" src="" alt="">
					<p>Standardized and consistent processes allow people to take necessary actions without letting essential details fall through the cracks. <br>

						Standardization also prevents people from having to reinvent the wheel each time they begin a process. <br>

						The same is true for the background screening process. While conducting background checks, all the necessarby steps must be followed in the right order to facilitate thorough and complete results.<br>

						Standardization by role is essential because it supports consistency across an entire job type. It helps your organization avoid errors associated with having a different background check process for each candidate.<br>

						While different kinds of background checks can be applied throughout the organization, it’s a mistake to allow the screening process to vary within the same job type.<br>
					</p>
					<p>Without a standardized background screening process, it’s possible to mistakenly leave out certain kinds of searches, which could lead to someone who isn’t authorized to work and one who possesses an expired or revoked license to enter
						your organization.

					<h2>
						Depending on the manual verification procedure
					</h2>
					<img class="image main" src="https://github.com/allabouttoday/source/blob/main/images/18_1076_HubPage_Illustrations_FNL_1x1_BackgroundCheck_kct45c.png?raw=true" alt="">
					<p>
						In today’s scenario, it is a must for background verification companies to have an efficient automated verification process to avoid costly mistakes. <br>

						Also, manual intervention is inevitable in some situations. Hence it is best to establish a process that integrates both automated and manual verification. This will save time, cost, and effort in the hiring procedure.<br>

						The best solution for this problem is to formulate a verification process that focuses on manual and automated screening, not just one of them.
					</p>
					<h3>Not Screening Every Employee Level</h3>
					<p>Hiring risk exists at every level of the organization, which is one key reason employers hire at every level to undergo thorough background screening. <br>

						This doesn’t mean the same background search should be conducted at every level or for every position.<br>

						Screening employees at every level should also include temps, contractors, interns, and other non-employees.<br>

						Not screening at every level can lead to financial or reputational losses, and organization will be open to potential risks such as:<br>

						Hiring individuals into accounting positions who may have committed theft or financial fraud.<br>

						Hiring individuals at any level who possess a degree from a diploma mill or who lacks the employment experiences listed on their resume.<br>
					</p>
					<h3>Not Verifying Key Information
					</h3>
					<p>A background check company will be careful to obtain correct information, but sometimes mistakes occur.

						This is often because multiple people have the same name, or there is a mistake in a Social Security number or birth date.<br>

						Take the time to verify an applicant’s information before conducting a background check so you can get accurate records.
						Along with the good things that come with the background verification process, there are some struggles that companies have to face too. <br>


						Companies that are aware of the background screening fold have come to recognize its significance and its advantages which help at making contracting expenses and work of reliable hiring genuine and capable employees.<br>

						In some cases Employees hired are new, they may be bound to be forced to bear the errors of their verification accomplice.<br>
