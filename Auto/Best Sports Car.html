          <h2>Porsche 911 (Carrera S and Carrera 4S)</h2>
          <center>
            <img src="..\images\porche991.png" alt="Porsche 911 (Carrera S and Carrera 4S)" />
          </center>
          <p>To date, we have driven the new 992 generation Porsche 911 on both Carrera S rear seats and four Carrera 4S four-wheel drive wheels. Both tests have suggested that the eighth-generation sports hero, with the rear engines is an all-wheel
            drive driver like the 991 has changed - and, if any, is ready to move the game away from its rivals.<br>

            Growing longer and slightly wider, 911 is available in 380bhp Carrera and 444bhp Carrera S forms. Both twins are turbocharged and, meanwhile, come out with eight automatic gearboxes. Handmade models are expected to arrive in the UK by
            early 2021.<br>

            Both versions use the so-called 911's 'widebody' shell (illuminated by the increased use of aluminum in its construction), while four-wheel drive is now the norm even for non-GT and hybrid-wheel-drive vehicles.<br>

            While there are as many reasons as ever for drivers who prefer to adhere to a clean car-driven back frame, the wide 992 wide axle track and fast driving speed seem to sharpen its handling very well. <br>

            Its turbocharged engine may not have the text marks of older Porsche space units, but it does work for the most sensitive terrain - and, totally, with a car that remains unequal between specific rivals of use, circular reliability and
            especially availability, daily use, splendor of any time of the driver.

          <h2>Jaguar</h2>
          <center>
            <img src="..\images\jagaur.png" alt="">
          </center>

          <p>The best-selling Jaguar fan of the highly respected E-Type designed for Lyons will tell you a lot about the development of the modern car market. When it was launched in 2013, we thought the consumer community would appreciate it as the
            latest and most reliable type of TVR - which favors eight-cylinder engines and considers it a cheap and powerful 911 front rival.<br>

            For a while, consumers did just that. But as the old car also focused on the purist sports car market heading into the Porsche Cayman and Alpine A110, the F-Type had to go with it. Six-cylinder models became popular, with the Jaguar
            creating another wave of interest in the car by providing it with a four-cylinder engine.<br>

            After its recent rise, the F-Type jumps every inch of the same market space as they always do. Over the course of the range, the new R-rival remains a 567bhp rival, £ 100,000 high-911 and Aston Martin Vantage, while at the low end, it
            costs less than $ 60,000 and makes just under 300bhp.<br>

            Jaguar's new style treatment with the car certainly gives it a new and unique visual appeal. So far we have only been successful in releasing the R AWD coupon, but we have been impressed with its V8 hotrod speed and sound but have
            impressed us with its precision handling and durability.<br>

            The F-type has never been as practical or perfect as its key competitor and is now less shy and more sophisticated in technology internally. There is, however, still much to be desired - and many reasons to hold one while you still can.

          <h2>Lotus Evora
          </h2>
          <center>
            <img src="..\images\lotus evora.png" alt="">
          </center>
          <p>It's been ten years since Lotus' mid-engined, 2 + 2 Porsche-chaser, Evora was introduced.<br>

            At the time of its launch, the car brought many qualities to accept but also mistakes of regret. Today, it maintains a chassis and a control system that both deserve high charges. Few sports cars with such immersion, good steering or
            riding and handling are convenient for life on British roads, and that is especially true now that Heet has launched the cheaper, cheaper GT 410 Sport.<br>

            However, what was doubtful about Evora's broader patent case back in 2009 has become a definite problem right now. This Lotus has never had its proper powertrain chassis. Although Hethel now heads about 430bhp from the soul-car of the
            Toyota-sourced supercharged V6, the powerful transmission of Evora remains the limit of your enjoyment.<br>

            A very small boot can make it difficult to visit prisons on the weekend, while a sturdy, inaccessible and old-fashioned interior exceeds the limits of acceptance on how easy a £ 80,000 sports car should be.<br>

            However, if you can find a way to enjoy it, you will taste the whole drive at Evora. Few cars combine the most glorious and insufficient.

          <h2>Chevrolet Corvette</h2>
          <center>
            <img src="..\images\chervolet corvette.png" alt="">
          </center>
          <p>Much has been written about General Motors' decision to gamble on this, the eighth generation of its Corvette sports car, by switching from a forward-facing engine to a mid-range. There were good reaso ns for doing so: it improves the
            distribution of vehicle weight and improves its direct handling capacity.<br>

            And there has been a much more controversial issue: the expectation of a moderate build on this operator in this segment of the sports car market, and the earlier suspension of Corvette's previous engines has made it a staple in the later
            generation of sports cars.<br>

            Whatever it took to finally convince MG to make a change, don't say it was worth it. The IC8 Corvette has the same metal-for-the-money and bang-for-your-buck price as any of its predecessors (the car is available under the Porsche 718
            Boxster in North America), and the cabin has a lot of ergonomic quirks, it is a driving experience that you will come back.<br>

            Bristling with flame-block-V8 flames, the C8 engine has a very good decoy response, has a good medium power delivery, likes to go back to 6500rpm and sounds great to do. With direct performance, it sounds great in line with the old C7
            Corvette. Probably not quite ‘supercar fast’ at all, however, with this amount, it’s impossible to be confused with any run-to-60mph number starting with three.<br>

            The C8 is treated with great stability and accuracy in our first test drive, feels in good condition and easy to drive faster than any of its predestined predecessors, though a slight numbness and on-the-limit understeer can take the edge
            of its appeal on track dates. Previously, however, the UK test should be brighter, while ready to track, test vehicles better equipped than the ones we tested already might feel better.

          <h2>BMW i8</h2>
          <center>
            <img src="..\images\BMW I8.png" alt="">
          </center>
          <p>The I8 is one of the most compelling and unusual sports cars we have tested over the years, not only because of its attractive plug-in hybrid powertrain, its attractive attractiveness and its international design, but also because of how well-accomplished the product - internally and externally - and how easy it can be living with it.<br>

It is available in both closed body styles and open roof. That its direct operation and handling capacity is a bit short of the best you can expect from a £ 100,000 sports car is a minor distraction; the problem only removes the edge of the car complaint when it comes to tracking driving.<br>

Ironically, the production of the i8 is expected to end this year, as the car, as we already know, has been heard insisting that the future sports car will be officially past. One you can catch while you can, of course.
