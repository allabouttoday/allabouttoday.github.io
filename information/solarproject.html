          <h2>Bhadla Solar Park, Rajasthan– 2,250MW
</h2>

					<span class="image main"><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.TPDbkY0TXFeppPb8IzVXaQHaFj?w=249&h=187&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.25&pid=1.7

            " alt="" /></span>

					<p>It is the largest solar power plant in the world, Bhadla Solar Park is located in the village of Badla, Rajasthan district in Jodhpur. Taking over 14,000 hectares, a fully operational site has been installed with a capacity of approximately 2,250 megawatts (MW).
					</p>
					<p>This large solar power plant was built by several companies, such as Rajasthan Solar Park Development Company Limited (a subsidiary of Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Limited), the Saurya Urja Company (a joint venture between Rajasthan and IL & FS Energy Development Company), and Adani Renewable Energy Park Rajasthan (a partnership between Adani Enterprises subsidiary Adani Renewable Energy Park and the Rajasthan government). Rajasthan's energy consumption is currently 10% of the state's total energy consumption
</p>
					<p>It is the largest solar park in the world in terms of energy production and the second largest in space. The average temperature in Bhadala ranges from 46 to 48 degrees Celsius. The geography is not quite good for the solar plant as hot air and sand storms cover the area regularly. Badla is a sandy, arid and arid area covering an area of ​​about 45 square miles. The average cost of this plant is about 10,000 thousand.</p>
<p>This solar plant was established by many stack holders. Development Company Limited (a subsidiary of Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Limited), Saurya urja Energy Company (a joint venture between the State of Rajasthan and IL&FS Energy Development Corporation), and Adani Renewable Energy Park Rajasthan are responsible for construction and maintenance.</p>

					<h2>Shakti Sthala solar power project – 2,050MW
</h2>
					<img class="image main" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.ynJqLjVnZrQP3M2IS4j6swHaEK?w=308&h=180&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.25&pid=1.7" alt="">
					<p>The solar park is fully operational until the end of 2019, the 2,050MW Shakti Sthala solar power project in Pavalagada taluk, Tumakuru district, Karnataka, is now the second-largest solar power plant in India behind the Rajasthan Basin</p>
					<p>Developed by Karnataka Solar Park Development Corporation Limited (KSPDCL) - a joint venture between Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and Karnataka Renewable Energy (KREDL), with assistance from the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) - Paxarada Solar Park covers more than 13,000 hectares of land. Rs. The project of 14,800 crore (approx. $ 1.95 billion) was reported to have benefited 2,300 Pavagada farmers, who were experiencing hardships due to the region being located in a dry area that attracted very little rainfall.

            Rewa Solar Power Project – 750MW

					</h2>
					<img class="image main" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.vXl53QMIglb3eyn2gtzw6wHaEH?w=326&h=181&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.25&pid=1.7" alt="">

					<p>The Madhya Pradesh’s 750MW Rewa Solar Power Project is distributed over 1,590 hectares and is run by Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Ltd. Built by Mahindra Renewables, Solengeri Power, and ACME Solar Holdings, the Rawa solar power plant and is one of the largest power suppliers to Delhi Metro.</p>

					<p>This is India's first only solar project to date that is funded by the Clean Technology Fund and also the only solar energy center in India to obtain an approved loan from the World Bank's International Finance Corporation. Ride on investment of Rs. For 2,800 crore (approx. $ 370 million), the installation of the plant reportedly saved Delhi Metro Rs 1,400 crore (approx. $ 185 million) for its project life. Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Limited (RUMSL), Project Implementation Company.

					</p>

					<p>This is India's first and only one-day project funded by CDF, a clean technology fund. It is the only solar power plant in India to have borrowed from the World Bank's International Monetary Fund. Rs. 2,800 crores, Delhi Metro has saved Rs. 1,400 crore for its project life by setting up this plant.

					<h2>Kurnool Ultra Mega Solar Park, Andhra Pradesh
</h2>
	<img class="image main" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.ZiFpcrbXFMYGG6k-Ju0X-wHaCx?w=300&h=131&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.25&pid=1.7"
					<p>Kurnool Ultra Mega Solar Park is still distributed over 5,932.32 hectares of land in the Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh and is one of the largest solar parks in the world at that time. The plant was built within two years by Andhra Pradesh Solar Power Corporation in partnership with Solar Energy Corporation, Andhra Pradesh Generation Corporation, and New and Renewable Energy Development Corporation using INR 7,143 crore.

					</p>
					<p>The 1,500MW solar park will also be operational in the nearby Kadapa region, which is connected to other major solar power stations. It can help increase solar power by an additional 2,750MW.

              <h2>Importance of Solar Energy</h2>

              <ul>
                <li>Fossil fuels produce a lot of pollutants. If you have ever been to California, New York, China, or any place that has mountains and valleys in its geography, you must have seen what a dirty wind looks like. Fog, dirty air, is bad for the environment, it is bad for our health, and it is bad for aesthetics. When pollutants get trapped in the air, everything goes haywire. Solar panels help in getting rid of air pollution. Your solar panels create clean energy that does not contribute to air pollution.</li>
                <li>There is a need to move electricity from large power plants to end-consumers through extensive networks. Equals power loss over long distances. Ever wondered what solar panels are used for? They are on your roof to receive energy from the Sun. Given the short distance, rooftop solar power is helpful in increasing power efficiency. Your energy becomes domestic and as a result you control your own bills and energy usage. In addition, solar power systems are sustainable, thus reducing the possibility of service interruption.

</li>
<li>Solar power systems generally do not require much maintenance. You only need to keep them relatively clean, so cleaning them once or twice per year will do the job. If in doubt, you can always rely on specialized cleaning companies, which offer this service within the minimum budget.</li>
<li>The sun gives us more energy than we can ever use, and no one can monopolize sunlight. Your solar power system will start saving money from the moment the benefits of solar power are visible in the long term. The longer you have your own solar power system, the more you enjoy the benefits of solar technology and support the environment. Apart from solar energy, solar energy has a second application. We often combine solar power with electricity, which is acquired through PV panels, but it is also possible to use the energy generated by the sun for heating purposes. This process is accomplished by deploying solar thermal systems that convert only sunlight into a heating solution.</li>
