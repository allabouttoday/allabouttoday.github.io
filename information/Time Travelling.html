            Time travel is travelling between two points in time. It may be going ahead into the future or back into the past. It remains a dream for scientists to travel in time. Most of them are trying to develop a time machine to do so. <br>
            But till now no one has succeeded in doing so. Not all researchers and scientists believe that it is possible for humans to travel in time. Scientific theories suggest it's possible to travel in time. But in reality it may not be.
          </p>
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>Time travel has been nearly impossible for many scientists for at least a century (120 years). Back in 1895, when H.G well described the time travel in his groundbreaking novel, 'The Time Machine'. It was mostly describing the physicists
            and philosophers writing serious research papers about time travel.At the end of the 19th century, scientists started investigations and described time as a dimension, just like space. If we can go anywhere in space and then similarly we
            can go in time. Some d the theory that describe the time travel are describe below.

              <h3>Special theory of relativity</h3>
              <img src="https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/prize-offered-in-the-october-1920-edition-of-scientific-american-for-picture-id463915311?k=6&m=463915311&s=612x612&w=0&h=2UtN7J8Dd9CQyPO2sM-20QzrY27O3tqB4P-ZlUvSRwY=" alt="">

              <p>
                As H.G WELL was a novelist but not scientist, time travel was still a theory until Albert Einstein in 1905 came up with his theory of relativity where time and space are comparatively measurable. The measurement of both space and time
                depends on relative speed of the person measuring it.<br> After few years, German mathematician Minkowski proved that, in Einsteinâ€™s theory, space and time are thoughts of two concept, but are single entity called space-time in single
                dimensions.<br> Later in 1915, Einstein came up with his second theory called general relativity. It describe the gravity in light but not as a force and gravity is function of space and time.<br>

                Clifford Johnson, a physicist described special relativity theory was enough to describe, time is much similar to space. If we can do everything in space then we can do in time like space travel. Special theory of relativity does not
                gives a way of going back in time but gives way of going forward and rate at which we can control. Einstein's theory of relativity fails to describes the space-time at small intervals.

              <h3>Twin paradox</h3>
              <img src="https://www.cpp.edu/~ajm/materials/twinparadox/twins_small.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="500px">
              <p>source: https://www.cpp.edu/</p>
              <p>It's also gives us a 'Twin paradox' that describes two twins having different ages. It's almost proveable in special theory of relativity that if a person A travel in space travelling with speed of light and person B(where And B are
                twins) is on earth. When person A comes back to earth then person A will be younger then person B.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Black Holes</h3>
              <p> The concept of Black holes also describe the twin paradox. The physictics have describe the same concept with a exotic structure called wormhole. If it exist could connect one location in space with another as described above
                (person A and B). Twin paradox was mostly describing travelling a head into time, but not back ward.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Grandparents</h3>
              <p>The concept of the 'grandparent paradox' describes the concept of travelling back into the past. If you travel back into time when your grandparents were young and by accident you killed him at young age. If means that your parents
                were not born and you will not be born, then how can you kill grand parents. So, 'Grandparent Paradox' proves travelling back in the past, will not be possible and physics cannot prove the same. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>String theory
              </h3>
              <p>String theory (M-theory) tries to combine quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of gravity. Quantum mechanics describes empty space is not empty, but filled with pairs of particles that pop in and out of existence. So, if a region
                is made where fewer pairs are allowed to pop in and out then this region will have negative energy density and its required to go back in time. But alone Quantum mechanics will not be able to provide scientifical prove whether we can
                go back in time. And combining Einstein's and quantum mechanics reamins a biggest challenge in physics. But string theory remains to be an another possibility.<br>
                According to string theory, space-time should have 11 dimensions: one of time, three of spaceand seven more which are very small. It still remains a question. Mark, whether we use extra dimensions to relate space and time
                When compared hwaking theory gives a better judgement.

              <h3>Chronology protection conjecture</h3>
              <p>Late scientist, stephen Hawking made a rule 'chronology protection conjecture' which describes that the physics laws should prevent travelling back into time.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Is it really possible to travel in time?</h2>

          <p>After 100 years, scientist and researchers are still could not find a way for time travel.<br> As there are still trying to extend the Einstein <br><strong>'special theory of relativity'</strong> that describes travelling ahead into future, but travelling back
            into time will still reamins a dream.
