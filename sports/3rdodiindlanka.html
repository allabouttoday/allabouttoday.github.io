<h3>Sri Lanka beat India by 3 wickets in the third and final ODI to pull one back for the home team after the Men in Blue took an unbeatable series lead by winning the first-two games in Colombo.</h3>
				<p>Sri Lanka ended their four-year losing streak against India as they registered a scrappy 3-wicket win in the inconsequential third and final ODI of the series at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Friday.
</p>
<p>Chasing a revised target of 227 from 47 overs in the rain-affected game, the Lankans rode on half-centuries from Avishka Fernando and Bhanuka Rajapaksa to win their first one-day international against India since 2017.</p>
<p>Fernando top-scored with 76 while Rajapaksa made 65 as the hosts crossed the finish line in the 38th over to pull one back for Sri Lanka after losing the first-two games at the same venue earlier this week.</p>

					<h2>Sri Lanka vs India 3rd ODI:
</h2>

				<p>India fielded 5 debutants in this game and the inexperience showed on the field even though first-timers Chetan Sakariya and Rahul Chahar did manage to grab a couple of wickets while Krishnappa Gowtham and Hardik Pandya chipped in with a scalp each.</p>
				<p>The Lankans were crushing at 194 for 4 courtesy the 109-run partnership between Fernando and Rajapaksa for the 2nd wicket but they made matters difficult for themselves by collapsing to 220 for 7 before the tail-enders Ramesh Mendis and Akila Dananjaya got them to safety.</p>

						LANKAN SPINNERS SHINE AT RPS

<p>Sri Lanka took advantage of a sensational batting collapse by India to secure an xx-wicket win in the third and final ODI in Colombo on Friday..</p>

					<p>The spin duo of Praveen Jayawickrama and Akila Dananjaya made best use of a rain break to dismiss the visitors for a lowly 225 in 43.1 overs.</p>
          <p>The rain-break at the end of the 23rd over, which reduced the game to 47-overs per side, helped the home team. The pitch suddenly had a bit of freshness and the ball would both grip and skid, making life easier for the spinners, who rocked the middle-order.</p>
          <p>The latest trend of young batters not being able to cope up with slow bowlers was on show as the middle-order looked clueless against left-arm spinner Praveen Jayawickrama (3/59) and off-spinner Akila Dananjaya (3/44), who, in his second spell, blew away the lower middle order with turn and bounce.</p>
          <p>However, Prithvi Shaw (49 off 49 balls) dazzled with his breathtaking array of strokes, while Sanju Samson again made batting look easy in his run-a-ball 46.</p>
          <p>If Shaw slog-swept Jayawickrama in front and behind square, Samson would play the inside out cover drive with effortless ease.

They added 74 runs in 13.2 overs and one canâ€™t fault anyone who was dreaming of something big as the duo injected life in a dead rubber.

However, after skipper Dasun Shanaka got one to skid and trapped Shaw, Manish Pandey's (11 off 19 balls) inclusion brought about a break in momentum.

Samson was in no mood to relent but an uppish inside-out check drive was plucked by Avishka Fernando at extra-cover, like a fruit from the tree.</p>

					<h2>INDIAN MIDDLE-ORDER FAILS TO FIRE
 </h2>
 	<img class="image main" src="https://th.bing.com/th?id=OIF.QQUGSzioxRt3R123D%2bJY9A&w=275&h=180&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.25&pid=1.7"
					<p>Post the break, when India resumed at 147 for three, the spinners suddenly started getting more turn and the rain had spiced up the pitch.</p>
				<p>Pandey, who, perhaps, will not get any more chance on the tour or even in near future, blew it away when Jayawickrama deceived him with a beautifully flighted delivery. It was a typical orthodox left-arm spinner's dismissal as the ball spun enough to beat Pandey, who went for an expansive drive.</p>
<p>Hardik Pandya (17) smashed three boundaries but Jayawickrama, already pumped up with twin scalps, got another one that turned enough to square up the colourful Baroda man.</p>
<p>Suryakumar Yadav (40 off 37 balls) again batted like a dream and hit seven boundaries but just like in the last match, the ball that sharply turns in became his undoing. The propensity to keep the bat behind the pads didn't work as Dananjaya's off-break found him leg before.</p>
